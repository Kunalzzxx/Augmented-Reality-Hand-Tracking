# Augmented-Reality-Hand-Tracking
This Python script implements an augmented reality hand tracking system using MediaPipe and OpenCV. It tracks a single hand in real-time from the webcam feed and overlays a stylized AR user interface (UI) on the hand, including glowing circles, radial ticks, arcs, and dynamic lines connecting fingertips. The script detects gestures like pinching (thumb to index finger) and visualizes gesture metrics such as pinch strength and angles with numeric overlays and color-coded effects. The UI elements respond dynamically to hand movements, creating an interactive and visually appealing hand tracking AR experience.
